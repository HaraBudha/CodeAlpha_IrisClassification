# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a Machine Learning classification model that predicts the species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements.

The model classifies flowers into three categories:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset available in Scikit-learn.
It contains 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Algorithm Used
Logistic Regression

## 📈 Model Performance
The model was trained using train_test_split and evaluated using accuracy score.
It achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic classification concepts in Machine Learning and shows how Logistic Regression can be used for multi-class classification.
